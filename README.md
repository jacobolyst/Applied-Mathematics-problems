<h1>Applied Mathematics problems</h1>
Mathematical-programming problems related to the tasks from different courses which I realized during my studies. The most frequent tool in which I present results is Jupyter Notebook. If You have any problems to render it, please use <a href="https://nbviewer.org/">Jupyter NBViewer</a>.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<ul><li><h3>Agent-based modelling of complex systems</h3>
